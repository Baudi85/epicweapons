opw.book.ce_galaxy.txt.page.1=    Every civilization looks to the stars for inspiration, guidance, and knowledge. The celestial Stalrir did the same, but instead of simply gazing upon them in admiration, he also shackled them.
opw.book.ce_galaxy.txt.page.2=Obtaining the blessing of his friend Wulfeld, who was the caretaker of the stars, Stalrir scooped a handful of stars from the heavens into his palm, depositing them into the lamp he used to guide his path in the darkness between stars.
opw.book.ce_galaxy.txt.page.3=Within the lamp, the stars seemed to drink in the light that the lantern gave, turning its inside inky as a shimmering radiance surrounded the object.
opw.book.ce_galaxy.txt.page.4=    Carrying the object to the field of battle, Stalrir did not stand before or behind his army as the other celestials did. Instead, he sneaked into the enemy lines, posing as a messenger. There he used the stars within his lamp to call to their brethren. And their brethren answered.%1    The stars hurled
opw.book.ce_galaxy.txt.page.5=their fury upon everything around Stalrir, propelling flaming boulders and chunks of ice the size of mead halls into Stalrir's enemies. His foes' ranks broke, erupting into chaos as the heavens rained fire upon them.
opw.book.ce_galaxy.txt.page.6=When the army was destroyed, there was nothing left but their remains and craters in the ground, except for Stalrir himself, who stood calm and untouched in the middle of the field. 
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.1=    The celestial Stalrir knew that he would eventually be called upon to duel with the other divines. Armies would clash and their champions were each eager to prove their devotion to their divine patrons, yet nothing would decide a battle so much as the results of one celestial facing another.
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.2=    Weaker of body than many of the other divines, Stalrir had neither the strength to lift a mighty hammer nor the training to use a bow. Instead, not knowing what else to do, he ventured into the night sky, as he was wont to do, seeking guidance.
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.3=He came to Wulfeld, a black giant and shepherd to the stars, brother to the moon. "Wulfeld," he began, "a calamitous battle approaches and I fear that I am too weak to survive a duel with another of my kind. Do you have any wisdom to share? A trick or a weapon?"%1    Wulfeld nodded to
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.4=his old friend and, in his silent way, beckoned the celestial to follow. Reaching down to the earth, Wulfeld plucked a branch from an ash tree. Then, calling his flock of stars together, he urged them into a tight, spinning mass.
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.5=The stars danced for him, throwing themselves into the press and whirling around in a joyful frenzy until they coalesced into a spinning pool of sparkling light. As they did, Wulfeld lowered the end of the ash branch into the crowd of stars.
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.6=Dazzled, Stalrir could not see the wood, but he saw its faint outline jerked about, a fishing line caught in a stormy sea.%1    When Wulfeld pulled the branch from the pool of stars, Stalrir could see that the tip was coated and capped in shimmering crystal, flickering through all of the colors of the stars.
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.7=Handing the slight wand to his friend, Wulfeld embraced Stalrir, gave his silent blessing, and urged his friend back to the earth to prepare.
opw.book.ce_wand.txt.page.8=As Stalrir descended once again, he felt little of the fear he had carried into the heavens, not knowing what exactly he held, but knowing that his friend and the stars he guarded would not lead him astray.
opw.book.ch_hammer.txt.page.1=    Urkolt, celestial of the deep sea, had no use for subtlety or strategy. His was the domain of the sea and the shores, the swirling currents under the ocean and the stones that cracked when storms swept the coast.
opw.book.ch_hammer.txt.page.2=If the sea and the storm could survive for all eternity without guidance, unable to be tamed, then he would not need such pampering or fretting either.
opw.book.ch_hammer.txt.page.3=Instead of deliberating with his captains and planning the opening battles of Raghnakir, as most of the other celestials were doing, Urkolt instead dove into the depths.
opw.book.ch_hammer.txt.page.4=Not knowing what he would find, but sure that the sea would provide, he eventually encountered Gardalung, the great watcher in the bottom of the sea which causes the coastline to shake and shiver when it hunts.
opw.book.ch_hammer.txt.page.5=Hostile and ever hungry, Gardalung flung its tentacles at Urkolt, wrapping his arms and legs and pinning him to the sea floor. When Gardalung opened its gaping maw to consume the trapped celestial, though, Urkolt bit the tentacle holding his right hand, tearing his arm free.
opw.book.ch_hammer.txt.page.6=Instead of fleeing though, Urkolt grabbed a stone from the seafloor and smashed it against his attacker. In the melee, Gardalung's ichor seeped into the ocean, transforming the mermaids into predators and monsters in Gardalung's image.
opw.book.ch_hammer.txt.page.7=When the beast was slain, Urkolt took both it and the stone from the sea back to his hall, where he fused the strength of his fallen foe into the rock before affixing the rock to a handle, creating the hammer that he carried into battle on the first day of Raghnakir.
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.1=    Urkolt is known for his place in the sea, as an entity that reveled in the chaos of storms and lets himself drift along the currents in the ocean's unknown depths. However, he was also the one who collected the souls of those lost at sea.
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.2=Whenever he happened upon one floating in the darkness, he cradled the soul in his arms, carrying it back to his home like a father would his child. There he gave the soul a place to rest, where the dead could eat and drink and take shelter from their memories of life and from the ocean that had claimed them.
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.3=    Yet there were some souls that deserved no place at Urkolt's table.%1    Criminals, murderers, and those who had committed acts best left unsaid that found themselves in Urkolt's undersea hall could not be allowed near his guests, nor would he dishonor his guests with the company of such villany.
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.4=Instead, he kept those wicked souls in a glass jar, so that he could watch them and so that they could see and be tormented by the rest and pleasures denied to them.%1    When Raghnakir came and the war began to send more and more souls to the sea, Urkolt's tumultuous forces were
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.5=floundering, breaking against the organized ranks of his enemies. Collecting even more vile souls than he knew what to do with over the course of the war, and facing the destruction of his armies, Urkolt condemned his criminals to an ever bleaker fate.%1    He turned the jar into a lantern, shaking it
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.6=to agitate the souls inside as its ghastly glow illuminated his hall. Binding the spirits with his magic so that they could not touch whoever carried the lantern, Urkolt took the lantern to the surface. There, surrounded by enemies and with his allies driven far away, Urkolt opened a hole in the lantern.
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.7=From there, the angry, vicious souls streamed out, venting their rage and taking their vengeance upon all who were near. As they set to their grim task, Urkolt watched and laughed.
opw.book.ch_lantern.txt.page.8="At last," he said to the whirling, shrieking souls, "at the end of all things, your pathetic lives finally have purpose and meaning."
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.1=    In the early battles of Raghnakir, the celestial Helr witnessed Urdir, one of her strongest and most able commanders, fall in battle. As one of her vassals, he had pledged his body and soul to her.
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.2=As Urdir's soul began to depart his body, he beseeched the queen of death and the underworld to not give him rest, but let him serve her further.
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.3=As he forfeited the mercy of death, she took his face in her hands and laid her forehead against his, the beautiful half of her face toward her allies and the half that was of a rotting corpse facing her enemies across the field. %1    Urdir gasped and his breath became a choking rattle as his
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.4=skin shrunk against his bones and withered away. Instead of shepherding his soul to the afterlife, Helr bound it back into Urdir's skull, which she pulled free of the desiccated body.
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.5=Speaking to his troops from his severed head, Urdir asked for those who were loyal to him and to their celestial to come forth, to bind themselves to him. Six stepped from the crowd and likewise waived their right to peace after death.
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.6=When each fell in the ensuing battles, their souls streaked back to Urdir's head to join him, inhabiting the same vessel and becoming immortal tools of their celestial.
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.7=They advised Helr on tactics, proving just as valuable during planning as when she summoned them in a spectral fog to charge the enemy lines, where they could strike down foes without being struck themselves.%1    When Helr herself perished, Urdir's head wailed, both for his lost mistress and upon
opw.book.dk_knights.txt.page.8=realizing the eternity that he had condemned himself and his men to as prisoners within his skull. They spoke never again and the skull was taken away to be hidden like all of the other divine weapons. There it sleeps, hopefully forever.
opw.book.dk_lance.txt.page.1=    Forged from a metal only found in Helr's underworld, she imbued this lance with her desire to horde souls. Wielding it herself, every mortal she struck down with it had their soul ripped free and stored in the spear.
opw.book.dk_lance.txt.page.2=After carving down dozens of enemies, Helr turned her spear against the other celestials and their champions, lashing out at them with the souls of the slain, turning her victims into her weapons.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.1=    The dwarves of the Mürdin mines were not so willing to surrender their homes in the face of calamity. They may have delved too deep into the rock, awakened too many angry monsters that were better left sleeping, but the mines were their home and the dwarves have always been a stubborn people.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.2=    Rather than flee or hide or retreat to the capital where their king was granting sanctuary to his subjects, the Mürdin dwarves conspired to craft a defense for themselves, something that could rival the weapons of the celestials.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.3=    So they dug deeper into the earth, pursuing a legend - or rather, a nightmare - passed down for generations within the mines. Deep in long sealed passages, beneath caverns where light had never graced the stones, the dwarves found what they were seeking: The lair of the Balgurdin. %1    This creature had,
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.4=centuries ago, burst into the mines, wreaking havoc and destroying everything that it could get its fiery claws on. Many perished, homes were destroyed, and half of the mines were turned into a battlefield while the other half were turned into a graveyard.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.5=The best that the dwarven heroes and wizards of the time could manage was to drive the monster away into the deepest, darkest depths of the earth, sealing every passage that they could as they retreated.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.6=    This time, though, the dwarves had returned to these passages and they had a dreadful purpose in their hearts.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.7=    They swarmed into the Balgurdin's lair, finding it asleep, the flames along its body dull as embers in its slumber. Even then, though, they could not slay the beast before it awoke. The fury of its flames incinerated many brave souls while its claws, horns, and fangs took many more. %1    When the battle was
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.8=over, the two dozen who had survived dragged the slain creature back to the mines through miles of tunnels, sealing them again lest this creature have kin or that worse things be hiding in the deeps.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.9=Taking the Balgurdin's head, the dwarves of Mürdin forged its steel-hard skull and the very essence of the fire demon into a battle axe that carried the hate and the primal fury of the slain monster.
opw.book.d_axe.txt.page.10=    Yet even this weapon was not enough to defend the dwarves caught in between the celestials' battles.
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.1=    The underworld is home not just to Helr and her host of the dead, but to creatures that we have only glimpsed in our nightmares. There, in our dreams, they should have stayed. However, Raghnakir woke sleeping giants and roused even the most peaceful of celestials to wrath.
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.2=It should have been no surprise when the thunder of war woke the demons that slept on the fringes of Helr's realm.%1    When the demons appeared, clawing their way up through the earth, landing on the beaches in ships made of bone and ice, and plummeting through the sky to wreak mayhem,
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.3=the battle between the celestials halted. Caught with their backs turned, their attentions so focused on each other, the celestials and their armies suffered horrific and swift losses. %1    Setting aside their differences for the moment, the celestials and dwarves alike joined their powers and
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.4=magics to slay the invaders. Each demon, even the smallest of them, could be as strong as an ox and as swift as a mountain cat, and those were the common ones. More and more of these monstrosities came to our shores every day, with no end of the horde in sight.
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.5=    Thus it was determined by Oltrist, the wisest and most battle tested of the celestials, that they had no recourse but to slay the invaders' leader, their king.%1    Resting upon the mountains that he uses as his throne, each peak another arm for his chair, the demon king lounged and
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.6=commanded his hordes through pain, force of will, and sheer brutality. There, upon the mountain slopes, the celestials managed to assault him in their desperation, striking with flame, thunder, and storm in their combined efforts. Here it was that the celestials Halfnir, Undé, Galfrid, and Malkin fell.
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.7=    It took all of the celestials' might and cunning to so much as wound the demon king, but in a moment of distraction, when the evil monarch was turned to face Helr's hordes of the dead and Urkolt's tempests, the rest of the celestials together struck the demon king's hand from his body.
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.8=    Never before wounded such and never before so pained, the demon king shrieked and roared and fled the field of battle, trailing molten ichor over the flattened mountains and leaving his hand behind.
opw.book.d_hand.txt.page.9=    Though his demons followed him, and though their kind have not been seen since, the hand, still moving with a life of its own, can by itself yet command some of the infernal forces beneath the earth. Beneath the earth, though, is where they should stay.
opw.book.f_crystal.txt.page.1=    Lantel, the dispassionate trickster of the celestials, had spent much time among his kin, the frost giants. Between his machinations and foolish games, Lantel had brought the frost giants pieces of mighty creatures.
opw.book.f_crystal.txt.page.2=Monsters slain by heroes, the pieces of which Lantel scavenged after each fight, the misshapen sons and daughters of celestials who had gone astray in their affairs, and even a spirit of the wind was brought by Lantel to the frost giants.
opw.book.f_crystal.txt.page.3=    Though not the most cunning of smiths nor the greatest spell weavers, the ice giants were incredibly strong and even they could create wonders with the materials that Lantel brought them. %1    Using many of the materials provided, the frost giants forged a twin set of blades tipped with spikes akin
opw.book.f_crystal.txt.page.4=to the icicles that form in the deepest part of winter. These blades were so cold that, if called upon, they would freeze the water in the air itself, propel frozen shards at foes, or simply steal the heat from a body within seconds. Yet Lantel, the wielder, felt no such chill.%1    When he faced his
opw.book.f_crystal.txt.page.5=foster brother in combat, though, Lantel and his trickery were no match for the strength, experience, and discipline of his brother, Thandirk. Desperate to escape, Lantel hid behind his blades until Thandirk finally managed to shatter one of them.
opw.book.f_crystal.txt.page.6=Reeling from the shock, Lantel begged for mercy and fled for his life. Thandirk, being too forgiving and honorable for his own good, did not pursue.
opw.book.f_crystal.txt.page.7=    Unfortunately for Lantel, though, the guardian Heimselk was waiting for the coward and struck him down as he fled with his one remaining weapon, lest Lantel and his treachery threaten the goodly celestials or peoples of the world again.
opw.book.f_dagger.txt.page.1=    Lantel was known for many things. Trickery, lies, love, devotion to his brother, fickleness that could be called insanity... But he is also known for his affairs and the monsters spawned from them.
opw.book.f_dagger.txt.page.2=In Raghnakir, he fought alongside his daughter, Helr, to bring the ruin of the celestials and revel in the frozen wastes that the world was becoming.%1    In order to arm himself for the conflict, though, he needed weapons and oh, did Lantel ever favor his daggers and hidden blades.
opw.book.f_dagger.txt.page.3=    To craft a weapon that could stay hidden, yet paralyze his foes when he struck with it, he sought out one of his other children: The gargantuan sea serpent Jormungandith.
opw.book.f_dagger.txt.page.4=Pretending a casual visit and a desire to reacquaint himself with his spawn, Lantel invited himself into Jormungandith's underwater cave. There they talked until Lantel proposed to play music and sing for his son. The music, sad, sweet, and calming, put the great serpent to sleep.
opw.book.f_dagger.txt.page.5=Once the beast was asleep, Lantel opened his son's great jaws and, in two swift, great pulls, ripped the venomous fangs from his son's mouth.%1    Lantel fled as the beast woke in rage and pain, screaming for his father, begging to know why Lantel had done this.
opw.book.f_dagger.txt.page.6=Lantel turned a deaf ear to it, though, and brought the fangs to the ice giant smiths who crafted them into twin blades that promised to stop any foe cold. The venom of the fangs could not be preserved, but the cold cruelty with which they were taken was forged into the daggers that they became.
opw.book.f_dagger.txt.page.7=    Without those fangs, Jormungandith was unable to save his treacherous father from Heimselk before the guardian struck Lantel down.
opw.book.guide.txt.page.1=In this world, you'll find horrible beasts, amazing weapons, and more! But you can only discover them if you §9explore§r!%1%1You may find weapons lying around that are far more powerful than your normal gear. In addition, there are 20 mystical magical weapons to find.
opw.book.guide.txt.page.2=%1You'll find them in dungeons throughout the world. Make sure to find and try them all out! Not only that, but you can upgrade to three different tiers of powers by killing the beasts!
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.1=    A gift from his father, Thandirk's sword became his symbol; the crystalline blade with which he made most of his legends.
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.2=With that blade and its magic to augment his speed and already prodigious strength, Thandirk could leap across battlefields in the blink of an eye and carve through a stone giant's granite hide. %1    Yet his reliance upon his sword and his strength would prove his demise in the final battles of Raghnakir.
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.3=When he allowed his cunning brother, Lantel, to flee from his fight, he had allowed his sense of honor and his thirst for battle combined to cloud his judgement.
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.4=Neglecting the mighty staff on his back, Thandirk streaked through his enemies, reveling in his strength as his blade sheared through stone and his lightning blasted foes. %1    However, since Thandirk had shattered one of Lantel's great weapons, Lantel's son blamed Thandirk for his death.
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.5=The great sea serpent Jormungandith, monstrous spawn of Lantel, crept up on and wrapped his enormous body around Thandirk. Unable to bite, lacking the fangs that his father had stolen, Jormungandith squeezed tighter and tighter, crushing Thandirk's breath from his body.
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.6=Thandirk struggled and fought, but so constrained, he lacked the room to swing his sword. Between his battle frenzy and his mounting panic, Thandirk again neglected the staff upon his back, which he needed only to lift to the sky with his free hand to summon and control its devastating power.
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.7=However, he refused to drop his sword and, in his last desperate moments as his heart stuttered and came to a stop, Thandirk summoned a bolt of lightning that shamed all others, one that even he could not wield nor withstand, and brought it crashing down upon both himself and Jormungandith.
opw.book.l_blade.txt.page.8=The lightning smote them both and, after the blinding flash and deafening explosion, nothing of the two combatants remained save a crater and the two weapons that the Lord of Lightning had carried.
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.1=    Thandirk, Lord of Lightning and celestial of the skies, had little use for subtlety or elegance in his youth. Every confrontation was direct, every battle a test of strength rather than skill or cunning.
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.2=It was not until Thandirk lost his sword while in the lands of the dark dwarves that he was forced to think with something other than his strong arm. %1    Weaponless and possessing no fine metals from which to forge another, nor a smithy at which to do so, Thandirk recalled his father's scepter.
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.3=Isolated from his friends and unable to flee as the dark dwarves closed upon the deep caverns, which were Thandirk's last hiding place, Thandirk called a bolt of lightning to strike a nearby tree.
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.4=From the burning, charred remains, he pulled a single, straight, blackened length of wood. Running back into the depths of the caves, he returned to a growth of crystals that he had noticed and admired upon first exploring the tunnels. %1    Prying them from the ground, he brought them to the surface
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.5=and, between the power in the few runes he knew and the strength of his hands, he molded the crystals into bands along the length of charred wood before forming the head of a staff, pouring his lightning into the crystals as he did to heat them and make them more pliant.
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.6=    When he was finished, the evil dwarves had marched a small army to within a few hundred yards of Thandirk's hiding place. Gloating and taunting him with the sword that they had stolen from the celestial, they felt confident as they strolled to finish off their foe.%1    Thandirk, however,
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.7=calm in the face of battle for the first time, rather than raging and lusting for the thrill, stepped from his cave and raised his staff into the air. Black clouds gathered overhead and the rumbling of a storm gave the dwarves pause.
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.8=Bringing his staff down, Thandirk thumped its base against the ground once. Lightning unlike any he had ever summoned erupted from the sky, searing the dwarves and turning the very dirt beneath their feet to glass.
opw.book.l_staff.txt.page.9=Terrified, they fled, though the lightning was always at their heels, striking them down from miles away. Only three of the dwarves survived to watch as Thandirk retrieved his sword from the wreckage before beginning his long walk home.
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.1=    Ijordo was one of the first of the celestials, taking her place alongside Oltrist as his wife. Yet after begetting her sons and daughters, she saw less in the beauty of celestials, men, giants, and their acts, instead increasingly preferring the solitude of the wilds in our mortal world.
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.2=When she longed for company, the deer and the hawks would speak with her. When she wished to create, to build structures or craft art, she planted then molded trees and flowers to her will.
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.3=When her family visited her, she taught them the predator's art of hunting and the prey's discipline of observation.
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.4=Thandirk was never the most apt at patience and listening, however her husband and foster son, Lantel, learned much from her and how the smaller animals of the woods turned their ears to the sounds around them.
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.5=Soon, she had a following of mortals similarly seeking to learn and grow as the plants and the animals did.%1    However, when men and dwarves began to overpopulate, spilling from their homes and seeking new places to raise halls and farms, they needed wood from the trees and hides
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.6=from the deer. Ijordo taught them too, knowing that the balance of predator and prey extended to include all mortal creatures, but there were places where even men and dwarves were forbidden from entering.
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.7=After several transgressions into her sacred places and tiring of punishing the intruders, Ijordo wrought a staff from brambles and ivy. With it she grew great thorny barriers thick enough to block out the light in order to repel invaders.
opw.book.n_staff.txt.page.8=Within these dark, green cocoons, her rule - and her protection - were absolute.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.1=    Ijordo, mother to Thandirk, wished for no part in the conflict of Raghnakir. She took precautions for eons to preclude her involvement in the war that fate demanded, distancing herself from many of the celestials, heroes, and monsters that were doomed to fight in the final confrontation.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.2=However, as is the nature of fate, she could not elude the role she was to play in Raghnakir.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.3=    When Surdeth, king of the fire giants, stepped from his world into the realms of men, he brought with him an inferno that scorched wherever he stepped, just as his breath launched cinders to ignite whatever they might alight upon, from dry thatch roofs to the very clothing on men's backs.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.4=    More than once did these stray coals float into Ijordo's domains, turning from sparks into crimson firestorms that roared out of control and swept through the forests that Ijordo had made into her home and her temples.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.5=No matter what she did, she could not stem the fires nor regrow the plants quickly enough to contend with Surdeth's destruction.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.6=The devastation then increased tenfold as the fire giant king's burning sword clashed with the other celestials' weapons, launching gouts of flame and lava with each strike. %1    Unable to bear watching her realm burn, Ijordo called upon the spirits of the wind.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.7=With their help, she created a sword from vines, stone, and wood which the spirits could inhabit. The blade, if it could be called such, was fragile, never meant to cut nor defend against a blow.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.8=Yet the next time Surdeth's blaze threatened Ijordo's home, she swung the blade and the spirits within summoned a gale that blew the fires out and swept the burning remnants away and back into Surdeth's savage kinsmen.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.9=Fire giants though they were, Surdeth's fires were too hot for even them and the blaze born on the wind left them seared and scarred.
opw.book.n_sword.txt.page.10=    Though she remained in her forests, Ijordo's actions gained the attention of the other combatants of Raghnakir. Soon enough, they invaded her woodlands or sought refuge therein and she no longer could maintain her neutrality.
opw.book.p_bow.txt.page.1=Within one of Ijordo's forests lived the witch Imlareth. A neighbor and sometime ally of the celestial, Imlareth agreed to help guard their mutual borders in the coming battles of Raghnakir.
opw.book.p_bow.txt.page.2=However, the witch's summoned spirits, golems, and other servants were not sufficient to repel the giants nor the great beasts and monsters that had been birthed by Lantel's affairs.
opw.book.p_bow.txt.page.3=Being smaller than a giant and not possessing the destructive magic of a celestial, Imlareth resorted to cunning.%1She found Uspell, the roaming plant that had grown from man's waste and venom.
opw.book.p_bow.txt.page.4=Imlareth slashed open its great bulb, where it stored the vileness that it had sucked up in the humans' wake. The poison that seeped out burned the earth, turning its plants black with decay and making the soil itself deadly to the touch.
opw.book.p_bow.txt.page.5=Protected by her magic, Imlareth snatched from within Uspell's bulb two things: The first was one of its seeds, dripping its vile fluids. The second was one of the strong, flexible stems that supported and nurtured the plant's bulb.%1From this second item she crafted a bow and quiver.
opw.book.p_bow.txt.page.6=Bound forever to the plant that had grown them, the quiver infused the arrows it carried with Uspell's malignance while the bow, enchanted to protect the wielder, altered the arrows so that, upon striking their marks, they burst apart and released the horrific poisons within as noxious clouds.
opw.book.p_swamp.txt.page.1=    The first item that Imlareth took from the poisonous plant Uspell was its seed. It could have been used to grow another plant like its parent, yet Imlareth believed that no amount of human evil or pollution could support a second such plant. There would not be enough to nurture it.%1    Instead, she used
opw.book.p_swamp.txt.page.2=her magic to strengthen the bond between the seed and its parent. In doing so, the seed hardened, becoming like a dark gem that continued to ooze poison, from which the wielder was shielded. From within its heart, it could always draw upon the deadly foulness that Uspell stored in its bulb.
opw.book.p_swamp.txt.page.3=    When the giants and beasts and armies of the opposing forces came to the forest, Ijordo invited Imlareth to stand at her side to defend the border. Imlareth declined, however, warning her neighbor-turned-friend away from where the witch would meet the enemy.%1    Standing alone with
opw.book.p_swamp.txt.page.4=the bow and seed made from Uspell's core, Imlareth waited for the oncoming foes. As they passed over a ridge and swept into the forest, she held forth the jewel-turned seed. From it, lakes of poisonous sludge poured forth, seeping into the earth and creating a massive swamp.
opw.book.p_swamp.txt.page.5=The nearby trees and animals that were caught in the flood instantly withered and died, yet so did the foes caught in the resulting mire. From the center of this bog, Imlareth hurled her magic and shot shaft after shaft of her poisonous arrows into the invading force.
opw.book.p_swamp.txt.page.6=Each time a foe slipped past her lethal shafts and attempted to draw near, the invader stepped into the poisonous swamp and quickly succumbed to its deadly influence.
opw.book.r_gauntlets.txt.page.1=    During Raghnakir, the dwarven king did all that he could to defend his people. However, the battles were so far afield that he could not protect all of his holdings and the clashes so profound that he could not shelter even his capital city from their destruction.
opw.book.r_gauntlets.txt.page.2=    Walls crumbled, homes burned, fields froze, and his people were driven to the brink by every disaster that their nightmares could conjure.%1    Their armies all but useless against the divine fury surrounding them, the dwarves began to lose hope.
opw.book.r_gauntlets.txt.page.3=As a last desperate act of devotion to their king and their people, the king's royal guard conferred with the greatest dwarven smiths and spell weavers. They offered themselves as sacrifices in order to make weapons that could save at least some of the dwarves.
opw.book.r_gauntlets.txt.page.4=Seeing no alternative, and moved by their selflessness, the king could not refuse. Within the guard, one was elected by his peers to remain as a champion to the king, deemed the strongest and most worthy to wield the weapons that would be forged.%1    Their lives, their strength, the very
opw.book.r_gauntlets.txt.page.5=essence of loyalty held within these guardians were taken and condensed, pounded into steel and bound by magic.
opw.book.r_gauntlets.txt.page.6=From the first twenty-five of these champions came a set of gauntlets, which granted the dwarven champion the strength of giants, such that the air itself compressed and exploded in a burst of light when he punched.
opw.book.r_gauntlets.txt.page.7=    With these he held great shields against the forces at play in Raghnakir. With these he forced open the jaws of the giant wolf, Redarn, before it could devour the castle. With these gauntlets, he fought to defend his brothers' memories and protect what remained of his city.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.1=    As Raghnakir approached, Oltrist spent most of his time cataloging his knowledge of runes.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.2=Knowing that he would die in the coming battle, he put all of his effort into passing on his knowledge to whomever would succeed him, as he alone of the celestials knew that a new generation of deities and mortals would rise from the ruin of Raghnakir.%1    Once his runes were transcribed, he created
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.3=shelters for mortals far beneath the soil, where neither fire nor ice could harm them, and put the peoples and animals in an enchanted sleep that would only break once the final battle had concluded.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.4=Even Oltrist, wisest of the celestials, could not see for certain whether anything would survive the coming conflict without such protection.%1    It was only once his labors were done and he had left his runes with the sleeping mortals did he think of his own preservation.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.5=Knowing even that he was fated to fall in the battle to the monstrous wolf Redarn, and knowing that it was his doom to slay his friend Soldan, brought back from the dead in Helr's army, he prepared himself a weapon.%1    Going again to the sun he had made, carrying a sword forged by the dark
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.6=elves who had long since disappeared, he spoke with his brothers, whose hearts were the sun. They invited him to use their power for one more creation, but begged him to wait until Raghnakir should begin.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.7=Oltrist spent three weeks with his brothers, reminiscing and mourning the coming carnage, until he saw on the land of mortals far below that the armies were forming to launch their first assault upon each other.%1    It was then that his brothers bid him create his final work.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.8=Oltrist drew his sword and gently slid it into the sun. His brothers' hearts were injured and pained as the blade pierced them, but they made no complaint as they heated the metal. They poured themselves into the weapon, exhausting their hearts and dimming the sun as they turned the metal into liquid fire.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.9=When Oltrist pulled the blade free, it shone and shifted, as though the metal were molten and swirling. Next to the darkened sun, the blade shone like a great comet. %1    It was with this weapon that Oltrist led the celestials and their allies against the giants, monsters, and traitor deities.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.10=Only as Redarn ate Oltrist, weeks after Raghnakir had begun, did the king of celestials finally see the sun reignite as his brothers' hearts mended.
opw.book.r_spear.txt.page.11=Even as he slid into the great wolf's stomach, Oltrist knew that the world would be looked after by his brothers and warmed long after he himself was forgotten.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.1=    Oltrist, king of the celestials, patron of heroes, scholars, wizards, and artists, began as a wanderer.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.2=When he and a coalition of his brothers and cousins finally overthrew the giants, driving them from the realms of mortals and the world that the celestials would call their own, he was hailed by his celestial allies as the wisest and most suited to be king.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.3=Within a week, however, others made claims to his leadership. Though these other entities (cousins to the celestials, twisted offspring, monsters, and other creatures) had not lent their aid in the battle, they each desired to rule in the giants' absence.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.4=Many challenged Oltrist to duels, though he and his brothers and growing family turned aside their challenges. After a while, though, Oltrist's opponents grew to be many and, among those, dozens were strong enough to threaten him.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.5=When his brothers went hunting without him one day, leaving Oltrist to administer the celestials and mortals from his hall, his enemies ambushed his brothers and slew them all.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.6=    When Oltrist heard of this, his fury was instant and fierce as he seized his sword to march to war. However, his wisdom and patience soon won out and his rage turned cold, calculating.%1    He invited his rivals to a contest.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.7=Whomever could do the greatest good for the worlds of men and celestials alike would prove themselves the most worthy to rule. From this, his rivals created the sea so that every living thing could drink. However, they forgot to heat it and watched the water turn to ice.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.8=Others brought metal ores to men, so that all could craft and invent. However, they forgot to teach men how to forge the metals and the ores were cast aside or left forgotten underground. Yet other rivals created stars and bred them like sheep, so that the lights could instruct and inspire both men and celestials.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.9=However, the rivals forgot to give the stars voices and their wisdom was kept in silence.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.10=    Many were their creations, some beautiful. Many others were monstrous, such as the creatures living deep beneath the earth or ocean which we only see in our darkest dreams. However, as they labored, Oltrist prepared his brothers for funerals. %1    Setting their pyres ablaze, he mourned
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.11=their passing, but as he did, he collected their hearts as their bodies turned to ash. He fused their flaming cores, pressing them together and molding them into a great orb. This sphere he hurled into the sky and set to running across the heavens.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.12=Thus was the sun born and, from its rays, the ocean thawed, men learned how to build fires and forge metal, and they had light to write by and make books chronicling the movements of the stars for maps and histories.%1    As Oltrists' rivals gawked at the sun, amazed and jealous, they began to alternate
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.13=between praising Oltrist's creation and demeaning its value. As they shouted and argued, however, Oltrist pulled forth a scepter that he had made, using an ever burning coal from his brothers' funeral pyres as the jewel at its top.%1    Raising the scepter, Oltrist called to his creation and the sun
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.14=answered his summons, both as its maker and its brother.
opw.book.s_sun.txt.page.15=Lending its power, the sun shot a pillar of fire down to the surface, incinerating Oltrist's gathered rivals and leaving the icy planes scorched and thawed, with his rivals' bodies left as charred husks that would become the mountains of our homeland.

opw.sequence.intro.2.line.4=Seeing as%1you have nothing to trade though,

opw.sequence.intro.5.line.9=That and the crossfire between%1the divine arms' wielders led us dwarves
